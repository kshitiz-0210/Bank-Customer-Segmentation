# Bank-Customer-Segmentation
Segmented bank customers based on financial behavior using PCA, Factor Analysis, and clustering. Cleaned data, reduced dimensions, and identified optimal clusters to uncover customer patterns, enabling targeted marketing and personalized banking services.

**Overview**

The Bank Customer Segmentation project aimed to identify distinct customer groups based on their financial behavior using a combination of data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques. The primary objective was to enable the bank to better understand its customers and offer personalized products and services tailored to their specific needs.

The project began with cleaning the dataset, where missing values were identified and appropriately imputed to ensure data integrity. Following this, dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis were applied to simplify the dataset by reducing the number of features while retaining the most important information. This not only improved model efficiency but also highlighted key patterns in customer behavior.

Next, clustering algorithms were employed on the reduced dataset to segment the customers into distinct groups. Various methods, including the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score, were used to evaluate and determine the optimal number of clusters. Finally, the clusters were analyzed and visualized against the original features to interpret the differences between customer segments.

This project provided valuable insights into customer profiles, enabling the bank to craft more targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction through personalized banking services.
